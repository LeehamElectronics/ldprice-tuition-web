## This repo contians the software I wrote for my tutoring business website.

#

I am still actively developing this website along with my main personal site, [ldprice.com](https://www.ldprice.com) and my other window cleaning business site [cleaning.ldprice.com](https://www.cleaning.ldprice.com) these two small businesses help support me financially while I continue working on my computer networking / software development / electrical engineering pathways!!

[ldprice.com](https://www.ldprice.com) will be more of a general overview of my work and services for building a bit of a public profile / resume builder ect, the two sub domains are purely business related.
